# Trimble-Bilberry : AI_Engineer_technical_exercise (Image Binary  Classification : Field vs Road )

## Objective

This is a binary image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks ( Inspired by AlexNet) and TensorFlow Keras API  on Python 3.
The objective of this task is to train a neural network to classify images of roads and fields.

## Approach




## Insights from  Data 
the first thing we notice when exploring our dataset is that the dataset is unbalanced and image resolution is not stable.
we notice that the road class is in majority. To solve this problem, I chose to increase the data of the minority class (Over sampling)
A small rotation is performed to equalize the number of examples in the majority class  



## Transformations (Preprocessing)





## CNN Architecture
